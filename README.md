# MedicalSystemDB

This repository contains a database for managing a hospital, including information about patients, medical staff, insurances, appointments, medical conditions, and medications. The database was developed in Oracle and includes ERD and conceptual diagrams, as well as the transformation of the system into logical and physical designs, in the third normal form (3NF). The implementation includes tables and referential constraints. Fifteen complex queries are presented, and in addition to basic functionalities, advanced PL/SQL concepts are illustrated, including the use of collections and cursors. There is also a message table and triggers for handling exceptions.
